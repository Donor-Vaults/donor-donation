Confidentiality: We each agree to keep the arbitration proceedings, all information exchanged between us, and any settlement offers confidential, unless otherwise required by law or requested by law enforcement or any court or governmental body. However, we may each disclose these matters, in confidence, to our respective accountants, auditors, and insurance providers. TERMINATION You agree that DONOR.FINANCE, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or your access to the Services and remove and discard any User Content or data at any time and for any reason, with or without notice, and without any liability to you or to any third party for any claims, damages, costs or losses resulting therefrom. USER DISPUTES You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other User in connection with the Services and DONOR.FINANCE will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto. DONOR.FINANCE reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any other User of the Services. GENERAL These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and DONOR.FINANCE and govern your use of the Services. You also may be subject to additional terms that may apply when you use the platform, third-party content or third-party software. The failure of DONOR.FINANCE platform to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be (or are otherwise) invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties\u2019 intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Services or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) month after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may not assign these Terms of Service without the prior written consent of DONOR.FINANCE, but DONOR.FINANCE may assign or transfer these Terms, in whole or in part, without restriction. If we fail to enforce any of our rights, that does not result in a waiver of that right. The section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made via email or regular mail. The Services may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Platform. The Purchaser may, at any time, assign our rights or delegate our obligations hereunder without notice to you in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of equity or assets, or by operation of law or otherwise. Nothing in these Terms of Service shall prevent DONOR.FINANCE from complying with the law. DONOR.FINANCE shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war or threats of war, terrorism or threats of terrorism, riots, embargos, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, governmental regulation or advisory, recognized health threats,as determined by the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control, or local government authority or health agencies, strikes or shortages or curtailment of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.");
